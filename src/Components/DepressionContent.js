                    Clinical depression
                </h1>

                <p class="sectionTag text-medium"> There's no single cause of depression. It can occur for a variety of
                    reasons
                    and it has many
                    different triggers.

                    <br />For some people, an upsetting or stressful life event, such as bereavement, divorce, illness,
                    redundancy and job or money worries, can be the cause.

                    <br /> Different causes can often combine to trigger depression. <br />For example, you may feel low
                    after being
                    ill and then experience a traumatic event, such as a bereavement, which brings on depression.

                    <br /> People often talk about a "downward spiral" of events that leads to depression. <br />For
                    example, if your
                    relationship with your partner breaks down, you're likely to feel low, you may stop seeing friends
                    and family and you may start drinking more. All of this can make you feel worse and trigger
                    depression.

                    <br /> Some studies have also suggested that you're more likely to get depression as you get older,
                    and
                    that it's more common in people who live in difficult social and economic circumstances.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sectionTag text-big"> Loneliness</h2>
                <p class="sectionTag text-medium">Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and
                    unique to each individual. Because it has no single common cause, preventing and treating this
                    potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically.

                    <br /> For example, a lonely child who struggles to make friends at school has different needs than a
                    lonely older adult whose spouse has recently died.
                    <br /> Researchers suggest that loneliness is associated with social isolation, poor social skills,
                    introversion, and depression.For example, a college freshman might feel lonely despite being
                    surrounded by roommates and other peers.<br /> A soldier beginning their military career might feel
                    lonely
                    after being deployed to a foreign country, despite being constantly surrounded by other troop
                    members.
                </p>
                <h3 class="sectionTag text-big">Family history</h3>
                <p class="sectionTag text-medium">If someone in your family has had depression in the past, such as a
                    parent or sister or brother, it's
                    more likely that you'll also develop it.<br />Not every person with a family history of depression
                    will
                    have depressive episodes. Knowing that your family history puts you at higher risk of becoming
                    depressed may give you greater incentive to control factors to lessen that tendency.

                    <br /> Dr. Tayim recommends these simple practices to boost your mood and potentially reduce your risk
                    of
                    becoming depressed:

                    <br /> Do mindfulness therapy, such as meditation or guided imagery, to ground you and help you cope
                    with
                    stressful events. <br />Numerous apps and online resources offer guidance if you don’t know how to
                    start
                    Cultivate flexibility and adaptability to stressful situations, environments or relationships.
                    <br /> Practice deep breathing and other stress reduction techniques
                    Exercise, whether it’s a leisurely stroll or something more aerobic. (Always check with your doctor
                    first to establish a safe level of exercise for you.)
                    Get outside to enjoy nature and sunshine

                    Alcohol and drugs
                </h1>
                <p class="text-medium">
                    When life is getting them down, some people try to cope by drinking too much alcohol or taking
                    drugs. <br />This can result in a spiral of depression.

                    <br /> Cannabis can help you relax, but there's evidence that it can also bring on depression,
                    particularly
                    in teenagers.

                    <br /> "Drowning your sorrows" with a drink is also not recommended. Alcohol affects the chemistry of
                    the
                    brain, which increases the risk of depression.
                    <br /> Physical effects:
                    <br />Drinking too much can damage your brain, liver, and immune system.<br /> Chronic drinkers with HIV
                    may
                    be
                    at greater risk for disease progression than those who drink very little or not at all (read
                    more).
                    <br /> Methamphetamines can lead to brain, liver, and kidney damage, impaired blood circulation,
                    significant weight loss, and tooth decay.
                    <br /> Drugs like cocaine and heroin can seriously damage your respiratory and circulatory systems.
                    Methamphetamines and cocaine can negatively affect your immune system, making it easier for your
                    body to get an infection.
                    <br /> Some substances interfere with HIV medicines that are part of an overall treatment plan.
                    Other effects:
                    <br /> The after-effects of a drug or alcohol “high” can create feelings of depression, exhaustion,
                    pain,
                    and/or irritability.
                    <br /> Getting high may cause you to forget to take your HIV medicines or forget to make and keep
                    doctor
                    and clinic appointments.
                    <br />Using drugs can make it hard for you to maintain your house, job, relationships, and social
                    supports—all of which are important for your well-being.
                    <br /> If you inject drugs, you may be at increased risk for transmitting or getting HIV. You may also
                    be
                    at risk for other infections that are transmitted by blood such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
                    Learn more about reducing the risk from injecting drugs.<br /> Using drugs can make you more prone to
                    risky practices, such as sharing needles or not using condoms.<br /> This increases the chance that
                    you
                    could transmit HIV or get a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that could make your infection
                    worse.

                <h2 class="sectionTag text-big">Personality</h2>
                <p class="sectionTag text-medium">You may be more vulnerable to depression if you have certain
                    personality traits, such as low
                    self-esteem or being overly self-critical.<br /> This may be because of the genes you've inherited
                    from
                    your parents, your early life experiences, or both.<br />Examples of personality can be found in how
                    we
                    describe other people's traits. For instance, "She is generous, caring, and a bit of a
                    perfectionist," or "They are loyal and protective of their friends."</p>

            <h1 class="sectionTag text-big">Illness..</h1>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-medium">
                You may have a higher risk of depression if you have a longstanding or life-threatening illness,
                such as
                coronary heart disease or cancer.

                <br /> Head injuries are also an often under-recognised cause of depression. A severe head injury can
                trigger
                mood swings and emotional problems.

                <br /> Some people may have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) resulting from problems with their
                immune
                system.<br /> In rarer cases, a minor head injury can damage the pituitary gland, which is a pea-sized
                gland
                at the base of your brain that produces thyroid-stimulating hormones.

                <br />This can cause a number of symptoms, such as extreme tiredness and a lack of interest in sex (loss
                of
                libido), which can in turn lead to depression.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sectionTag text-big">Stressful events</h2>
            <p class="sectionTag text-medium">Most people take time to come to terms with stressful events, such as
                bereavement or a relationship
                breakdown. When these stressful events occur, your risk of becoming depressed is increased if you
                stop
                seeing your friends and family and try to deal with your problems on your own.
                <br /> The top five most stressful life events include:
                <br />Death of a loved one.
                <br /> Major illness or injury.
                <br /> Moving.
                <br />Divorce.
                <br /> Job loss.
